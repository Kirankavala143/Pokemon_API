Project Title: Pok√©mon API Search Application
üß© Overview:
This Pok√©mon API project is a web-based application that allows users to search for Pok√©mon by name and dynamically view relevant information and images fetched from the PokeAPI. It demonstrates practical use of modern web technologies including React.js for the front-end, and integrates asynchronous API calls to deliver interactive user experiences.

üéØ Key Features:
Search Functionality:

Users can input a Pok√©mon name (e.g., "Pikachu", "Bulbasaur") to search.

A request is sent to the Pok√©mon API to retrieve Pok√©mon data.

Dynamic Data Rendering:

The API response includes Pok√©mon details such as sprite images, types, base stats, and abilities.

Images and stats are dynamically rendered on the webpage using React state updates.

Error Handling:

User-friendly error messages are displayed if the Pok√©mon is not found or input is invalid.
